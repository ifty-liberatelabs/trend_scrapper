        "description": "Making it without looking 👀 to show you how easy it is 👌🏽 PARĀOA PARAI (FRY BREAD) Makes: 20 1 cup chilled miraka (milk) ¾ cup boiling wai (water) 1 Tbspn īhi (yeast) 1 Tbspn huka (sugar) 4 Tbspn hinu (oil) 4-4.5 cups puehu parāoa (flour) 1.5 tsp tote (salt) + oil for frying Mix all ingredients except flour and salt in a large bowl. Leave for 15 mins. Add flour and salt (start with 4 cups, and add more if it’s too sticky), gently combine, knead for a few minutes, then rest 1 hr, or until doubled in size. Lightly oil the bench, then press out dough and divide into squares by rolling a plate along it. Fry in hot oil till puffed + golden. Transfer to a dish lined with paper towels. Devour 🔥🤤 My one rule if you make this: make extra (I usually double the recipe) to bless a neighbour, kaumātua or someone living alone 🖤 For the full method, tips, and chef’s notes, visit our website: www.maimoa.nz/frybread #frybread #friedbread",

        "description": "🚨 WAKE. UP. NEW ZEALAND. 🇳🇿 We’re not “lucky.” We’re not “fine.” And we’re DEFINITELY not “better than most.” We’re broke. We’re tired. We’re bleeding potential. And the worst part? THEY want us to stay silent about it. 🤐 But not today. Not ever again. This is your reminder that WE are the country — not the politicians, not the corporations, not the spineless status quo. 🧠 Are you really okay with: ❌ Paying $650/week for a shoebox rental? ❌ Waiting 8 months to see a doctor? ❌ Watching your culture get watered down in the name of “inclusion”? ❌ Being told you’re lucky just because other countries have it worse? ❌ Staying quiet to avoid being “cancelled”? Nah. We’re DONE. This is the NEW ZEALAND reality check 🇳🇿 And it’s coming from the people who’ve HAD ENOUGH. We don’t want to be better than the worst — we want to be the BEST. 💥 RANT. SHARE. STITCH. COMMENT. 💥 If you’re pissed off, GOOD. 💥 If you’re fired up, even better. 💥 This is YOUR video. OUR fight. OUR home. 👇 SOUND OFF IN THE COMMENTS: What’s the ONE thing in NZ right now that makes your blood BOIL? Let it out. Let’s flood this feed with TRUTH. We’re done being polite. We’re done waiting. We’re done apologizing for wanting BETTER. 💬 The silence is OVER. 🎤 The people are LOUD. 📢 Let the world hear what New Zealanders REALLY feel. 🔥 STITCH THIS. 🔥 SHARE THIS. 🔥 FOLLOW for more unfiltered TRUTH. #NewZealand #Aotearoa #NZPolitics #RealTalkNZ #WakeUpNZ #CostOfLivingCrisis #KiwiLife #NZHousingCrisis #ThisIsNZ #ProPeople #AntiWoke #TruthBombs #SpeakUpNZ #UnfilteredTruth #NZTikTok #CallItOut #WeDeserveBetter #FightForNZ #KiwisRiseUp #NotOkayNZ #RantTok #NZVoices #WeAreThePeople #AngryKiwis #NZYouth #SpeakTruth #NoMoreSilence #EnoughIsEnough #ReclaimNZ #TimeToAct #TikTokNZ #NZProblems #UndeniableTruth #RawAndReal #ForThePeople #PowerToThePeople #StandUpNZ #UnapologeticTruth #ThisIsNotFine #WeBuiltThis #NZStrong Let’s go. 🇳🇿🔥✊",
