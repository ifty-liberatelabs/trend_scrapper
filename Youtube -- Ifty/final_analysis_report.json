And that is doing absolutely nothing. That was a complete failure. It's cleared about 1% of the smoke. Now, this is a mainstream $50 Russell Hobbs air purifier. So, this one's going to take the air through three separate layers of filtration. It's definitely taken some of the thickness out of the smoke. I give it 30%. Oh, and it's not dead. That's good. At $200 now, this is a high-end smart air purifier. While the last purifier could handle rooms up to 14 m squared, this should be able to do 100. The other perk being that this is app control. You can kind of see the outline of the purifier. Pretty damn impressive. I would actually say 70%. And now at $1,000, this is the absolute top-of-the-line model from Dyson. It's got sensors for every type of particle, and it can apparently capture 99.9% of them, even in large rooms. Okay, go. Wow, look at it go. That thing's insane. There's some staining, but 100% of the smoke is gone in about 7",

But two years have gone by and she still mentions him. Daddy. Yes. I want to go with Eden. I heard you. One day, we received a wedding invite with an all-star Korean entertainment lineup. And Eden was going to be the ring bearer. For the record, Eden's dad is Korean. His mom is white, but his dad's jeans just kind of gave up and didn't put up a fight. What does RSVP mean? respond soon via pigeon. We RSVPd to the wedding so our daughter could see Eden again. We packed our luggage and loaded all the important family members into the car. After 7 hours of driving, two meals, and one emotionally damaging Happy Meal mixup, we arrived at the ceremony and my daughter couldn't wait to see Eden. She even prepared a love note for him. But when Eden finally emerged, he was with another girl. As he walked by, my daughter stared in disbelief. I had no intention of explaining the wedding tradition to her as I witnessed the sparks fade. He got the silent treatment and like all girls after a heartbreak, she just wanted to hit the dance floor. The next morning, I witnessed Eden try to shoot one more shot. Airball. As a 3-year-old girl dad, I was quite relieved. [Music]",

His teammates left him with only a few bullets and a small amount of food. They ordered him to stay and stop Soviet soldiers. As soon as his teammates left, the soldier picked up his sniper rifle and started loading bullets. But by the time he aimed, his teammates had already disappeared into the forest. Now his top priority was to remove the shackle. In a panic, he raised his sniper rifle and pulled the trigger at the chain. Bang! A loud blast. The sharp pain made him scream. The chain was too thick. He couldn't break it. He had to find another way. He searched his backpack and found a pair of glasses. An idea came to his mind. He carefully removed the lenses with a small knife, pressed the two lenses together, then broke off a piece of pine branch and scraped off the pine resin with his knife. He chewed the resin in his mouth until it softened, then stuck it around the edge of the lenses. He inserted another piece of pine branch and poured water into the gap between the lenses. He had made a simple magnifying lens. Then he placed some moss on the iron nail and focused sunlight onto the moss with the lens. Soon the moss caught fire. The soldier quickly gathered dry branches to make the fire burn stronger. Once the branches burned out, he poured cold water onto the stone. The sudden change in temperature caused the rock to crack loudly. He tried to pull out the nail, but it was not enough. Still, he didn't give up. He kept repeating the process. The nail slowly became more exposed. Before long, a large hole had formed in the rock. A few more times, and he would be able to pull the nail out. By noon, the soldier was squatting next to the stone, eating canned food. Suddenly, he heard the sound of an engine in the distance. He quickly grabbed his sniper rifle to look. It was a Soviet military truck passing by. Luckily, they didn't see him. He knew he had to hurry. But worse, he was running out of branches. If he couldn't escape soon, even if the Soviets didn't find him, he would freeze to death in this cold winter. Even worse, his food was almost gone. Even the water in the iron bucket was down to the last cup. This was his final chance. He poured the water onto the rock, then quickly picked up his tools and pried at the cracked stone. But the nail still wouldn't budge. He took out all his bullets and collected the gunpowder in a metal can. He poured the powder into the hole, covered it with a rock, then threw in the burning moss and hid behind a large stone. Boom! The gunpowder exploded with white smoke. He quickly got up to check, but the nail still wouldn't move. Frustrated, he kicked the nail twice in anger. It still didn't move. Then he used his gun strap to hook onto a distant rock. He grabbed the rock with both hands and smashed it against the nail. From day to night, he kept striking it. His hands were covered in blisters. Finally, he tried again. The nail started to loosen. With one strong pull, he yanked the nail out. He was finally free.",

            "transcript": "Joining me now is one of the finest thinkers of his generation and author of best-selling works, including his latest on democracies and death cults, Douglas Murray. Uh there's a new author who hopes to be an international bestseller, too. She has a book called A Different Kind of Power and she's got Oprah spruing it. A different kind of power is kindness. Absolutely. It's all those things that you think are weaknesses or are taught are weaknesses. empathy, uh, sensitivity, um, self-doubt and humility. They they're powerful. Douglas, you've called Jinda Ardurn the queen of performative caring in the past. Uh, did she exercise what she preaches when she was prime minister of New Zealand? Well, very much not. And by the way, it's so bewildering that uh clip with Oprah because Justindra Aden says all the things we're taught the weaknesses like empathy. I'm sorry. I as far as I know in the education systems across Western countries, it's nothing but empathy. uh most of politics, the media and education is all that we should all be as empathetic as possible and we have to understand other people and like we're not taught that that's a weakness. If anything, everyone is oversted with the idea that it's the single greatest virtue. And as Jindra showed and demonstrated when she was premier, the uh the fact is that it doesn't get you very far. It certainly doesn't get you everywhere. Uh simply being uh uh somebody who says they feel empathy or speaking in a sort of broken husky uh uh voice sounds like it's going to crack with emotion with at any moment because you're just so overwhelmed with empathy can actually do uh some pretty mean and unpleasant things to people uh like uh going through the harshest lockdowns of I think any country uh outside of the communist world uh during the COVID uh pandemic. IC it's it's it's quite extraordinary and also from somebody who who says that things like self-doubt are taught as sort of things that are problems again no I mean I wish Jindra Arden had had more self-doubt she said on the recent book tour that she she thinks she wasn't sort of suited to be uh prime minister I wish she'd had that self-doubt a few years ago because she could have saved her countrymen an awful lot of heartache take she could have and all that uh sensitivity and empathy was missing when she was even preventing Douglas pregnant New Zealand women from returning home. There was a case I covered at the time of a woman who had to reach out to the Taliban for help cuz she was in Afghanistan because New Zealand would not permit her to return to give birth to her child. But while we're talking about uh performative caring, Greta Thunberg has been deported from Israel in economy class, the humanity. Oh dear. Uh and Douglas, President Donald Trump wants her to consider anger management classes. She's a strange person. She's a young angry person. I don't know if it's real anger. It's hard to believe actually, but I saw what happened. Anger management. I think she has to go to an anger management class. That's my primary recommendation for her. But Greta remains a heroine to to many, including to this far-left activist in Australia. She's an influencer who recently Douglas gave an address at the National Press Club. Raising awareness, drawing attention to, and growing media coverage for this genocide that Israel is perpetrating against Palestinians is not Instagram activism or social media selfies. Let's talk about the fact that raising awareness is not weakness and that it's not performative. Douglas, what's your response to that? Is that heroism? Is she using her privilege for good as that activist claims? Well, first of all, I mean, I've I've never been a fan of Greta Thunberg. I wasn't a fan of hers even when she was effectively created as a construct to make people make it basically impossible to oppose her because you remember she she was this school truent uh from Sweden and not only was she a child but she was also was she autistic or something so um you couldn't criticize her or everyone said why are you beating up on the autistic girl child uh who simply wants to wreck all of our economies and like why would why would you uh say anything negative about her? And of course that was that it was just it was a total political stunt. Uh she clearly just sort of created in more than one ways by her parents uh to to sort of be this weapon uh against fossil fuels and so on. I mean she knew nothing about that. She knew nothing about energy costs or or or fossil fuel extraction or anything else. I mean, she just left school early to be demonstrabably even more ignorant than she would have been. And then through some weird part of her autism, perhaps she moved from loving the green movement to uh to loving the green movement of Hamz. And so she's, as I often said, she's color consistent at any rate. Um they talk about a genocide which is not going on. Uh but as we now know from this yes obviously performative piece of activism where they turned up with a boat full of Instagrammers and less aid than uh than Israel uh gets in every other hour in normal times. Uh this this performative thing of of of trying to land in Gaza. I mean and in a way I was sorry that she didn't land because it would have been interesting to see the welcome that Hammaz might have given her. But of course, what we know about Greta Fernberg and this is um her unbelievable ignorance of the conflict that she was actually trying to sail into this time. Uh uh the reports are that uh when the Israelis boarded the ship, took them safely uh um to port in I think in Ashdod and uh they were trying to show the activists the footage that Hamz took themselves on October the 7th of their enormous pride in raping and butchering Israeli women and and others. Um and Greta Thunberg and co apparently turned their faces away because they didn't want to see the reality uh that started this war certainly this phase of the war. They didn't want to see it. Uh so once again all these people who are about raising awareness and so on they will literally turn their faces away from reality if it doesn't fit their bigoted blinkered picture and idea of it. And she was asked about that once she got off the plane, Douglas, and she, I think, referred to the footage as propaganda, and she wasn't going to uh watch that propaganda. I mean, it really is quite incredible because, as you know, you've seen that footage. I've seen that footage. It comes mainly from uh Hamas. They're the ones who filmed it. And uh it's work they're very proud of. Uh so for her not to even have a look at what started this uh this war uh just shows you where she's at. Uh let's go to the LA riots. We've seen incredible scenes of violence and destruction, looting, arson, police officers being attacked. And curiously, or perhaps not curiously, we've seen the Mexican flag flying high through a lot of these protests. Whilst the American flag has been burnt, it's been spat on. It's been stomped on. Here is one protester explaining why he's desecrating the American flag. I'm dragging them cuz they're dragging us. Immigrants built this city. There's no denying that. And when they're trying to take that out, it's not okay. It's just not okay. Douglas, Donald Trump could not have hoped for a better ad for his immigration and his deportation policies than what we are seeing in LA right now. just the violence and destruction and lawlessness is uh I think just uh lending further weight to his policies. Yeah. You know, it funny enough all of this ties up together, doesn't it, Rita? I mean the the uh the democrat policy of sanctuary cities uh where um if people break into America illegally and uh then are in the US these cities uh will act as sanctuaries for them have caused cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco to become even slumier than they were in the leadup to this under massive amounts of Democrat rule. I mean uh uh up to 12 million people uh around that as a conservative estimate broke illegally into the United States during the Biden administration. And the Trump administration has said that they want to prioritize deporting the more than half a million illegal migrants who have criminal records. And it was a raid to try to arrest criminals in Los Angeles that has led to this outburst of rioting of attacks on uh American police and others. And once again we see this odd thing in our time. the Democrats when they decided not to police the border and just to encourage people in and to encourage people in that include criminals and yes include some people who want to be law abiding once they're in the United States but are costing American taxpayers whilst they're being there by their presence by social security that they sign up for and much more. Um it it's they still pretend that it's the empathetic good thing to do to encourage from the border onwards literal lawlessness and that anyone including federal agents who are trying to enforce the law are the bad guys. I mean this is upside down to a crazy extent. And you're right, Rita, there couldn't be a better uh um uh boost to what President Trump is actually trying to do because he keeps saying these people who are coming include people who hate our country and then the American public see people uh lording the Mexican flag and oh Palestinian flags and all of the others of course uh and literally burning the American flag, protecting foreign criminals and assaulting American police officers. Um, I don't doubt that in a small amount of the online uh left and and fairly large numbers of people on the streets of LA, they want to back the lawlessness and attack the police. But I think the American public, as they demonstrated last year when they voted Donald Trump back into office, have demonstrated that actually they do side with the police. The American public do side with law and order. They don't side with people who pretend that it's the police that provoke disorder rather than the rioters. They don't fall for this idea that innocent uh people are just expressing their their fear about about uh um uh ICE or anything else and that therefore they can't resist going and looting the local Apple store in LA. I mean, it's so upside down all of this. And until we get past this era in which doing the wrong thing is celebrated and doing the right thing is condemned, we are going to continue to be in all of our countries in unbelievable trouble. Absolutely. Before you go, I want to ask about the fantastic piece you had for the spectator in recent days on Richard Hermer's campaign against Britain. That's the headline. Douglas, he's the attorney general. He says he just wants to make the world a better place. Why do you say he has a campaign against Britain? Once again, somebody who just wants to make the world a better place. and in the case of the attorney general of England and Wales um has in doing so uh consistently uh uh war against his own country uh he uh he's getting cover from other lawyers about this who say oh no he just accidentally uh uh ended up as the uh lawyer for Shinfane IAS Jerry Adams he just you know it happened to be his turn to represent al-Qaeda terrorist after al-Qaeda terrorist ISIS families and so on as if it could have happened to anyone. But that wasn't the case. Her's campaign for years as a lawyer has picked up every sort of anti-British uh person he could and represented them as hard as he could. Um it it's it's again it's it's so bewildering in so many of our countries that in the west that we have so many people in very powerful positions who are who are against the countries that whose people they're meant to be supporting. They're meant to be representing. I mean I'm just amazed. You know, I would like the British government to have the interests of the British people at heart, as I would like the Australian government to have the the cares of the Australian people at heart, and the American government to have the cares of the American people at heart. But again and again, we have elected and in this case, unelected representatives who just seem to have spent their career hating the country that they then want to represent. I don't know what we've done in all of our countries to deserve people at the top of our societies who are meant to be looking out for us, looking out for everyone apart from us. There's this self-loathing that is so prevalent, isn't it? In in the political class, in the activist, academic class, amongst celebrities, it's fairly dominant in the culture and it's pretty disturbing. And uh I noticed uh the the attorney general recently compared the Tories and reform to the Nazis. So he's a as a great thinker as well there, Douglas Murray. Um he has apologized for that. Uh Douglas Murray, thank you so much for your time tonight. Great pleasure as always.",

            "transcript": "The boy was practicing ninjutsu. Suddenly, he made a noise while walking. So, his master immediately stood up. He punished the boy without hesitation. The boy endured the pain and continued to practice. This was a required course to be a ninja. At night, the boy couldn't sleep because of the pain, but he didn't dare to make a sound. His senior sister saw this. She applied ointment to the boy's wounds. That night, the ninjas were training, but the boy showed mercy to his senior brother during the sparring match. The master was furious and severely punished the boy. The boy groaned in pain on the ground, but no one came to help him. The next morning, as the master opened the door, the boy had already recovered. The master was satisfied. That day, the master asked the boy to fight with a blindfold on. The boy couldn't rely on his sight. He had to fight by hearing. Thanks to the boy exceptional talent. He quickly defeated his senior brother. The boy really liked his senior sister. He even hugged the girl. One day, the girl won the duel. According to the rules, she had to stab the loser, but the kind-hearted girl couldn't do it. She put down the knife. So the master got angry and punished her. And for the first time, the boy hated his master. Because in the boy's heart, the senior sister was the person closest to him. The girl was locked in a cage. At night, the boy secretly gave water to the senior sister with a bamboo skewer. He also tried to persuade the girl, but the girl didn't give up. One rainy night, the girl escaped. Under the boy's watchful eyes, the girl slowly climbed up the wall and fled, but unfortunately, the girl was caught again. In order to punish the escapee, the master had his man pierce the girl. This made the boy furious. 10 years passed. He became a top ninja, mastering a variety of skills, proficient in all kinds of weapons. The man placed his hand on the steel nails, and he even did push-ups on them. This was his training method. One day, the man was doing laundry. A woman asked him for help, but the man instantly saw through her identity. What cla are you from? The woman stopped pretending. She took out a knife and attacked. The two immediately started fighting. The sound of the fight woke up the laundry shop owner. When the owner went outside, he only saw the shaking washing machine. The man completed an assassination mission, but the master asked him to execute a defector. Looking at the other person's appearance, the man instantly thought of his senior sister, so he prepared to take revenge. The man suddenly ambushed his master with a knife, and he also became a traitor. So, here's the question. Do you like this kind of ninja?",

            "transcript": "We're going on some of the most expensive dates in the world. Like this $500,000 date that includes the entirety of Disneyland, all for ourselves… a $100,000 date at this mega complex with a massive waterpark and indoor ski resort… a $50,000 private island date… Best date ever! a $10,000 date cooked by Gordon Ramsay… and we even convinced superstar singer Madison Beer to go on a date with my most awkward friend. All starting with this $1 date: a Ferris Wheel! - Here's $1. - Ok. - Ladies first. - Thank you. Take notes, men. Is this safe? I see why it's only $1. The $1 date has now begun. It's, uh, making a lot of noise. Why is it making that noise? It's just the wind, right? I usually film 20, 25 days a month, and I don't really get to spend much time with my fiancee, so I literally picked this video so me and my fiancee could spend more time together. I love you, even if you didn't take me to Disneyland. Well… not yet. But for the final date in this video, for the first time in history, Disney reserved the whole park just for us. That's it for the $1 date! Let's head out to the $10,000 dinner date— After you, babe. Turn off the park. I'll see you guys there. And now, the $10,000 date where we're gonna be recreating our first-ever date with sushi. - After you. - Thank you. She doesn't know this, but Gordon Ramsay's gonna be making us the meal for this date. Thank you. There you go. You look really cute. I picked this just for you. It's been a long time since my first date with Thea, and now that we're engaged, I'm really excited to explore the world's most expensive dates with my fiancee. You're probably wondering, \"Why is this the $10,000 date?\" Why is it? Gordon Ramsay himself is gonna be cooking our meals. The Gordon Ramsay? Yep. Come on in. Welcome to Lucky Cat Miami! It's nice meeting you! How's it going? What an amazing night this is gonna be. Oh, I'm excited. Yes. We're gonna kick off with some pea guacamole with some delicious crackers. Did you say peacock? I said pea guac! Oh, pea guac, oh… Not peacock, babe. To celebrate this $10,000 dinner, some seriously exclusive sushi. Ladies first. Cheers. Yeah, this is good. We have a delicious gourmet fried chicken, wonderful fried rice, and duck bao buns. Duck tacos? Bao buns! Duck tacos. Bao buns! You can yell at me. I will do in a minute. You're pushin' my limits, man. Enjoy. I want you to take the first bite. I knew you were gonna do that. It's only the $10,000 date, and we already have the world's best chef cooking a romantic dinner for the 2 of us. Nothing could possibly ruin this moment. Chef. What are you guys doin' here? No, no no, no. - I got you. - Come on, man! Don't rip it! I'm not ripping it, chef! I'm not ripping it! Oh my goodness, mate. Why are you disrespecting his restaurant? This is supposed to be a romantic dinner! Nolan, mine's burning. That's it. I'm done! What are you? An idiot sandwich! That is worth 10K alone. You guys have turned it to a nightmare! For $10,000, Gordon had a romantic surprise for our final course. This is nice! This is romantic! This is actually very romantic. Aww. Thank you. This 10K date was amazing. I can't imagine how insane these dates are gonna get later in the video. The $50,000 date is this entire private island, so me and Thea brought some friends with us to make this a quadruple date. Wait, what? What is that? This is Tom, the turkey. Please tell me we're not eating Tom. We are not eating Tom. I didn't know if this was like a Say-Hi-To-Your-Dinner thing as you arrive. We have this entire $50,000 island and everything on it to ourselves. I say the best way to kick off an island date is to go jet skiing! Let's go! Best date ever! You might recognize Grizz and Hase from the video where they spent 74 days in the wilderness together. The day I took that hood off and saw you was the best day of my life! And you saw these two when Josh spent 22 days in solitary confinement. These three spent weeks away from their wives, so I thought I'd give them some quality time together. This is the best date we've ever been on! Does the wife approve? I approve! This is how I make good with all the people I put in prolonged places. Oh my gosh, that was so close! Hey, Jimmy! It’s Nolan! Yo! Uh-oh, we're bouncin'. Nolan is flying solo for this date, but later on, he'll be going on a date with Madison Beer. I, uh— the great outfit… Everyone, the island is all yours. Go do whatever you want! So we all enjoyed the luxuries of this $50,000 island date. All right everyone, heads up! Like hitting golf balls that are also fish food right into the ocean. - Thea, you show me how it’s done. - I actually don't know how to do this. Now we're getting couples' massages on the beach. There is just a person on my back. Very relaxing. Grizz and Hase were playing some beach volleyball… against their wives, of course. And Josh and Kenna were having a picnic on the beach. I forgive you for taking him away from me for so long. - Welcome in, guys. - Oh wait, there's rose petals. I mean, I laid those just for you. For 50 grand, we all get these luxurious bungalows. Where do the petals lead? I mean, look where the petals lead. Into the lovely master suite. I made a heart just for you. It is so pretty. And you picked them yourself? - Oh, I made this myself. - Wow. And as the sun was setting on this $50,000 date… To our loved one! Cheers! …Nolan was the only one at dinner without a date. Until Tom the turkey showed up. Nolan, we found you a partner! Uh, I'm all good on Tom. And after dinner, we did some couples dancing. Rate our dance move. Again. Got it? Come on! And after dark, we had a beach campfire, and I had a surprise for everyone. Cue the fireworks show! And lightning at the same time! - Nolan, your date showed up! - Tom the Turkey! Yo, why are you standin' so still? That's it for the $50,000 date! I'll see you guys at the next one. For double the cost of the previous date, we get this massive indoor metropolis all to ourselves. There's a giant theme park, the largest indoor water park in America, even its own weather control system so they can have the largest indoor ski slope in America. Ooh, it's so cool. This is terrifying! And while Thea loves skiing… I haven't told her… I have no idea how to ski. Babe, this is massive! You're scared? Don’t be scared. I'm not scared. Nah. You're good. Hey, what's over there? - What? - I'm freakin' terrified. - What did you say? - I'm excited! Ok, you got it? Babe, grab the straight— Babe, stop! How do I stop? Babe, I'm starting to think that you don't know how to ski. No, I— I know how to ski. - How do I stand up? - I got you. Ah! Oh, no. Babe, stop! Babe, help! Thea, make me stop. Ok. I got you. How do I stop? Legs together! Legs closed, legs closed! What, are they not closed? Yeah, skiing is so much fun. Anyways, let's move on with the date! With so much to explore in this shopping metropolis, it felt like doing ten dates in one! From winning prizes in an arcade… …getting a hole-in-one in mini golf… - Look at that! - Yeah! …or building each other custom teddy bears. I love it. And where I normally do these kinds of videos by myself or with my friends, doing this with the person I love most was kind of magical. Being able to do pretty much anything you could ever want to do on a date— It felt like being a kid in a candy store …literally! Ooh, chocolate. Whoa. What is this? Uh. Hey, ma'am? What is this? They're Hershey's. Can we replace these with Feastables? Sure. Ok. Oh! Much better! If you haven’t already, try Feastables. It's the best-tasting chocolate on the planet. Let's keep the date going. We now have an entire waterpark to ourselves, and we just wanna take a relaxing swim together. Isn't it crazy that we're in the middle of a mall? It's like as big as the ocean. Up next, we actually got Madison Beer to go on a date with Nolan. Do you think Nolan has a chance with her? We're about to find out. For the $250,000 date, Madison Beer, the two-time Grammy nominee, platinum-selling artist, with over 3.5 billion streams worldwide, is going on a date with… my awkward friend Nolan. - Hello! - Hey. - Great to meet you. - How are you? Nice to meet you. And while Nolan is on his date with Madison Beer, me and Tareq are currently tucked away in the bathroom with a walkie that communicates directly to a mic in Nolan's ear. Where are you from? - I'm from Long Island. - New York? Yes. Where are you from? Nebraska. Not much out there besides corn. - Cool. - Yeah. No, he's talking about corn! In this seven years I've known Nolan, I have never seen him this nervous before. So to help Nolan out, I spent $250,000 on Madison's dream date. From driving her favorite car, getting VIP treatment at an MLB game, and an over-the-top sushi dinner, all to give Nolan the best shot of securing a second date. Tell her you like her outfit. A great outfit. Thank you. We told the waiter to help us wingman Nolan. I'll be your server. Welcome to Bar Siesta. You guys look amazing. I like your shoes my man. Dude, thank you. But it was quickly clear that it wasn't working. How's the weather? How's the weather? Cool. He’s falling apart. Nolan is not used to talking to attractive women. - You've watched the videos before? - I watch all the videos. What's your favorite video? The one where they were underground for 100 days. Madison Beer watches our videos. I never expected that. Same. I don't really eat meat. Vegan? Vegetarian? Pescatarian, 'cause I love sushi. They're getting to know each other, this is nice. - Sorry, I just got lost in your eyes. - Aw, that's so sweet. Ohh, he hit it! He took the shot! I was staring into the abyss. I don't… - Oh, not my eyes? - No. As they finished eating, I had one last idea to help Nolan. I want you to tip the waiter $10,000. My card is in your wallet. That guy was so nice. I think we should tip $10,000. I would love nothing more. - Nolan has a gift for you. - We left a little something for you. Wait, are you guys serious? - Thank you. - I appreciate it. - Here are the keys. - Thank you. Let's hit it. Madison really loves animals, so their next stop on their date is an animal farm. Nolan's only problem now was that the petting zoo was an hour drive away. Me and Tareq are still listening in. What's it like going up in front of thousands and thousands of people? I just love my fans. They're the reason I get to do stuff like this and live my dreams. He's warming up and he's getting better with time. We made it to the second part of the date. The Gentle Barn, a sanctuary that rescues abused animals. What made you start loving animals so much? I have a lot of anxiety, and I feel like they just are a calming reminder of peace. I feel a sense of calm around you. You are smooth with it. But visiting animals wasn't the only thing on our agenda. They're gonna give you guys $25,000, and I'm actually going to match them, and I’m gonna give you another 25,000. And then it was time for me to ask an important question. You two ready to head to an Angels baseball game? - Let's do it. - Sure am. Do you mind if me and my fiancee join you guys for the next part of the date? Am I allowed to say no? No, 'cause I paid for it. I mean, you paid for it, right? And then we had an entire suite to ourselves at an Angels game. This view of the game is insane. We got custom jerseys with our names on the back. And after almost all of us made it on the jumbotron… a crowd began forming around us. You'll be in a video, say \"Hi.\" Anyways, we should probably head to the next part of this date. And for the final part of the $250,000 date— What are we doing, Nolan? Sushi dinner and an ice skating rink with some of the best sushi chefs on the earth. I can definitely say I've never done anything like this. I gotcha, I gotcha. Thank you, Jimmy. Tonight we prepared for you all a tasting menu. How much does this amount of fish cost? A couple thousand. How do you think we got up to the 250K price tag? Definitely looks like my type of bite of sushi. Oh my God. - That is so good. - Wow. And then we all enjoyed some of the best sushi I've ever had in my entire life. This is the best date ever. - Thanks, Nolan. - Anytime. The 250K date, I think we could all agree, was a lot of fun. Nolan, you had a question you wanted to ask. I do. Oh, God. Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. My shoe was just untied. Would you like to go on a second date to Disneyland with me? Yes. Let's head on over! And now it is time for the most expensive grand finale date. We have Disneyland all to ourselves! This is gonna be awesome. Let's go ride some rides! Disney won't just hand over their keys to anyone, but for this once-in-a-lifetime date, we were given the entire park for one night. And with so much to do, we had to bring the boys, our friends from the island, and of course… Madison and Nolan. Yo, once we’re at the top, this is gonna have a crazy view. But our first stop is this absolutely insane Star Wars ride. All right, that's cool. Holy smokes! Look how big this is! Normally, people can wait hours for this ride, but my friends and I walked right in. Yo, strap in. All right, who's ready for the Star Wars ride? Is now a bad time to mention I haven't seen the movies? What? This is crazy! How did Disney build all this? This is wild. Oh my Gosh. Nolan, protect Madison! Yo, can you believe we're doing this right now? Yeah, this is insane! - That was awesome. - Once in a lifetime! This is crazy! That was amazing! Every other cart was empty. We have this whole place to ourselves. Disneyland is awesome! That was sick! And after that ride, what could be cooler… …than building your own lightsaber? Oh, yeah! Coolest lightsaber! Up next, we're all gonna ride this giant Ferris Wheel. We're back to where this video started. You could say it went full circle. I've never been on a Ferris Wheel that looks like that! Yeah, this is massive! It feels like we're stepping into an old movie. Come on in, babe. This is like the $1 date, but in Disneyland and much bigger. Much bigger! You can see the entire park up here. Wow! How does this compare to our $1 date? I mean, it's so much better. It's very romantic here in Disney. Wonder what Nolan and Madison are doing. Fist bump. Let's go. Things are not looking good for Nolan right now. I can't wait to play games. Yeah, that sounds fun. - Are you gonna win me something? - Of course. Yay! Are you gonna win me something? Oh, you betcha! Let's go! With his eye on the prize, Nolan challenged me and Chandler to a friendly competition. This is what you're competing for. - A worm? Babe, do you want that worm? - Yes, I really want it. Ok, boys, I'm gonna have to win this one. - All right, I wanna win this for you. - Please. 3, 2, 1… Go! - Nolan! - First one, first one. Let's go! It's, like, curving. Two! That's two! You need three to win. This is the grand prize. It's all yours. For you. You can feel the tension in the air right now. Gah, come here! But you know I couldn't lose to Nolan like that. Yes! Yes! Oh my goodness! Let's run it back! Yes! - Yay! - Here y’go, babe. The Three P. Here we go! We won again! That was fun! It's fun winning. There are no words to describe how special it is to have Disneyland all to ourselves. And I think we all made memories that are gonna last a lifetime. Whoa, babe. There's a puddle. You're a gentleman! No wet feet for you. Take notes, boys. And to wrap things up, we have one final surprise. We're gonna be eating dinner in front of the Disney castle. - Oh my! - What? All right, I don't know why Disney's going all out for us, but thank you guys. - Oh my gosh. - Wow! - This is crazy. -This is beautiful! Everyone, come on, sit down. Cheers to the greatest date in history. Cheers! Yes! This was an awesome night. I'm glad I can enjoy it with all of you. Cheers! Of all the dates I took you on, which one was your favorite? Definitely this one. Yeah? Yeah, ‘cause everybody's here. We should do this more! Rent all of Disneyland? Yeah. That was awesome. And to wrap up the video, for the first time in Disney's history, they're going to do a private parade for all of us. Let's head on over. I gotta say, this date is gonna be so hard to top. Huge thanks to Disney for absolutely blowing our minds with this experience. This was truly a once in a lifetime. If you don't have notifications on, make sure you turn ‘em on so you don't ever miss a video. Chandler— Subscribe!",

The owner thought it was useless, so he tossed it into the trash can. The boy was shocked when he saw it. He pretended to help clean the store, but then quietly moved next to the trash bag and took the egg successfully. It was still warm, so he carefully put it in pocket and went back home with his father. What could be inside? When the boy back home, he quickly ran to his room and took a basket. He lined it with paper to create a makeshift incubator. Then turning on a desk lamp and in the soft glow of the light, the boy seemed to see a tiny life, he placed the egg in the basket and sprayed some water, hoping that it would hatch soon. Several hours went by. There was no sign of any change. The boy patiently waited, and two days passed, yet there was still no movement. Just as the father called the boy to go camping, he sprayed some water on the egg once again. Then he turned to leave. The egg gently trembled, but the boy and his father already left. The following day, as the warm sunlight filled the room, the silent egg finally cracked open, a beak repeatedly struck the shell, causing the crack to widen more and more. After relentless effort with day and night, the little creature finally broke free. It was a small yellow duckling, so the little duck began its adventure. It slowly crawled over the computer, jumped onto the helmet under the desk, then slid down the clothes to the floor. Next, it hid inside the boy's sweater. It was warm in there, so the duckling fell asleep. But then, another accident happened. The father picked up the clothes and put them into a basket. When the duckling poked out its head, it was covered again by a piece of clothing. Then the father placed the basket near the washing machine. He started putting the clothes in one by one. Was this the end of its life? But the duckling miraculously crawled out of the basket. It was incredibly lucky. Just then, the boy came home. He saw the egg had cracked. He realized the duckling had hatched. He immediately began searching around. Then he came to the washing machine and started checking the clothes. But the duckling had just slipped past him. It reached the window. This was its first time seeing the outside world. Finally, the boy found the duckling. He was overjoyed and decided to always stay with it. The duckling also felt warmth.
